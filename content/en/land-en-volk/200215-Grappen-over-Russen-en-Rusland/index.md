  A Russian speaking English sounds like a criminal (starting at 1:00). And Russian,
  according to [Trevor Noah](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Noah), ‘sounds
  like someone’s playing a vinyl backwards’ (imitation starts at 4:06). Plus more humor
  about Russians, Russia, and the Russian language, by comedians like Louis C.K. 
  Followed by jokes from the Russians themselves, shared by Ronald Reagan.

#### Louis C.K: A Really Crazy Place

About the time [Louis C.K.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_C.K.) went to Russia in his twenties. It was 1994.

‘Somebody told me that the Wall had just come down in the Soviet Union and that Russia was a really *crazy* place at the time. So I said, I'm gonna go there.’ (starting at 1:07)

Several versions are online. This one has Russian subtitles. **Россия была безумным место в то время**, Russia was a crazy place at that time.

Not everyone found it funny. See/listen to [How Louis C.K. doesn't know a damn thing about Russia](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3ws3t5) (2015). See/read [You know who else met with Russians? Louis C.K.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2017/03/08/you-know-who-else-met-with-russians-louis/6F2thvxy6GoE9yNDKwd5zJ/story.html) (Boston Globe, 2017) and [Louis C.K. on His Miserable, Nihilistic Vacation to Post-Soviet Russia](https://www.vulture.com/2015/05/louis-ck-talks-about-his-awful-trip-to-russia.html) (Vulture, 2015).

#### Dan Soder: Scariest White People

On the usefulness of a Russian accent. "You think dis bad neighbourhood?" as crime prevention, and Russians as the scariest white people.

There's also a version with Russian subtitles (2015), besides [Russians are scary](https://youtu.be/oRIsC764Nn4) from 2013. <br/>
**Ты думаешь это плохой район?**

#### Ronald Reagan: Soviet Jokes

The 40th President of the United States (not a comedian, but certainly an actor) had a complicated relationship with the then Soviet Union, which he (in 1983) called an [Evil Empire](https://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/reagan-calls-soviet-union-evil-empire-9777621).

Nevertheless, he visited the heart of that Empire (in 1988) and made an effort to say **доверяй, но проверяй** ([trust but verify](https://youtu.be/As6y5eI01XE)) while standing next to Gorbachev. That went over much better.

He made another attempt at Russian at the [Moscow State University](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsuniversiteit_van_Moskou), when he tried to say [желаю вам успеха](https://youtu.be/1lutYGxMWeA?t=56) (I wish you success). It seems to take a moment for the audience to realize it was Russian. But then: applause. Success after all.

Reagan also told Soviet jokes (‘which reveal that they got a great sense of humor, but they’ve also got a pretty cynical attitude toward their system’) and it was all good.
