seo_description: About the interview between Tucker Carlson and Vladimir Putin (06-02-2024)
intro: >-
  An interview becomes legendary when it gets its own page on
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vladimir_Putin_Interview). On February 6, 2024, Tucker Carlson spoke with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. The report (127 minutes) offers a good, or at least broad, opportunity to hear the Russian perspective on the war against Ukraine.

#### Rurik

About a quarter of the more than two-hour interview was devoted to answering the first question, or rather, to Putin’s opening monologue. It began in 862 with Prince Rurik; from there, returning to the present was quite the journey. In and around Moscow, it was [cinema-worthy material](https://www.thedailybeast.com/moscow-milks-tucker-carlsons-putin-interview-with-free-theater-screenings).

You can watch the full interview (with chapters) on [Carlson’s website](https://tuckercarlson.com/the-vladimir-putin-interview/), and below, from Carlson’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TuckerCarlson).

Fortunately, a version was also found where Putin speaks in Russian ([Kremlin](https://www.youtube.com/@kremlin) 2023, 126 m).

#### Reactions
Negative reviews were already circulating before anyone had seen anything. See [The biggest overreactions to Tucker Carlson’s Putin interview that no one has seen yet](https://thespectator.com/topic/biggest-overreactions-tucker-carlson-interview-vladimir-putin/) (The Spectator, 08-02-2024), or hear from [Hillary Clinton](https://youtu.be/uFnsRbapyb4?si=IBTU1JD4DmSZNF3f). After the release, the reactions did not improve, with descriptions like [overtly ridiculous](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kimmel-bashes-tucker-carlson-over-overtly-ridiculous-putin-interview) (The Daily Beast), [softball interview](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/08/media/vladimir-putin-tucker-carlson-interview-reliable-sources/index.html) (CNN), [sycophancy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/09/tucker-carlson-putin-interview-journalism-sycophancy?ref=mc.news) (= flattery) (The Guardian), and [nonsense](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68255302) (BBC).

#### Aftermath

During the conversation, relations seemed quite friendly, but that changed afterward. Carlson compared Putin to [an over-prepared student](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/tucker-carlson-throws-putin-under-the-bus/ar-BB1j7UH8) and called his "denazification" argument 'one of the dumbest things I'd ever heard'. Putin, in turn, was not complimentary about the interviewer. See, for instance, [Putin Humiliates Tucker Carlson After Interview](https://www.newsweek.com/putin-humiliates-tucker-carlson-after-interview-too-soft-1870167) (Newsweek, 15-02-2024) and [Putin (...) mocks Tucker Carlson’s questions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/15/vladimir-putin-tucker-carlson-interview-footage-sharp-questions?ref=mc.news) (The Guardian, 15-02-2024).
