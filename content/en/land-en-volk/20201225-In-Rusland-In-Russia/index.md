  Three friends. Four trips to Russia. Moscow in spring, 
  [Kamchatka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka_Peninsula) in the fall, 
  and in winter to the [Baikal Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal), 
  [Murmansk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmansk), 
  [Salekhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salekhard), and Saint Petersburg. 
  You have to see what those three came back with. ‘Whatever man wishes to see 
  in our Mother Russia, is there to find.’

#### An exploration

Well, [Vincent Urban](https://www.instagram.com/vincenturban/), [Max Neumeier](https://www.instagram.com/muxsux/) and [Tim Höddinghaus](https://www.instagram.com/timhoeddinghaus/) are not just occasional filmmakers with a simple drone and camera. **In Russia – в России** is also (as described on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/flyADpC1Ono), see there for more) ‘an exploration of all the different lenses, viewpoints, and expectations one can apply in a travel film’. Compressed into six minutes, which is short for a travel log but long for a promotional clip. This is both.
