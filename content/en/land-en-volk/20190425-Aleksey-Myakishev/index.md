#### Kolodozero

The photographer did something similar (between 2011 and 2015) in Kolodozero (**Колодозеро**), a village in [Karelia](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE_(%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8F)) where in winter you’re more likely to see snow than people. Images from the series can be seen on [Photoshelter](https://alekseymyakishev.photoshelter.com/portfolio/G0000BpDdw_F5xu0) and [Viewbook](https://myakishev.viewbook.com/kolodozero), with slides and commentary on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/51674930) (1 min).
