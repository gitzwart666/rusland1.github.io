  (1991), Alexey Titarenko (1962) took what may be his best photographs in his
  hometown of St. Petersburg. At least, many of his most famous works, found in
  series like City of Shadows (**Город теней**). There was much to document, but
  Titarenko did more than that.

#### St. Petersburg

‘Major photo series include "City of Shadows" (1992-1994), "Black and  White Magic of St. Petersburg" (1995-1997), and "Time Standing Still"  (1998-1999). In those series Titarenko paints a bitter picture of a  Russia (seen through the lens of St. Petersburg), where people live in a world of unrealized hopes and where time seems to have stopped.’ ([All About Photo](https://www.all-about-photo.com/photographers/photographer/88/alexey-titarenko))
