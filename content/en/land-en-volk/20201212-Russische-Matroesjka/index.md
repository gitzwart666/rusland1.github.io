  You need to know at least two things about one of the classic symbols of
  Russia. First, the
  [matryoshka](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroesjka) (**матрёшка**) has only
  been made in Russia since the late nineteenth century (around 1890). There’s
  something Japanese in it too (some claim Chinese), and it was originally a
  children’s toy. Second, and take note, a matryoshka is a matryoshka.

#### Matryoshka ≠ Babushka

I get it, you’ll say, but not everyone understands or knows that. The matryoshka is often called a babushka – and really, it’s better to say nothing at all if you’re going to say that. 

Difficult for Mrs. Bellinga, a tourist in Russia, and a fine example of Dutch people at their worst. "Babushka, that’s what they’re called." Even the stress is wrong. Everything is wrong. Unfortunately, it wasn’t too bad for the Bellinga family, but watch [In Russia, things didn’t go quite right](https://youtu.be/zOG3rgAwrow) if you’re in the mood for some frustration. A *%! is a *%! and a matryoshka is a matryoshka (not a grandma), period.

<br/>

#### Layered

Whether its roots lie in the Far East or not, the matryoshka has become fully Russian in 130 years. Maybe it’s because it expresses something about the layers of the country, the people, and even their language. There’s always another surprise, which still fits perfectly.

Watch one video (by year), and then another will follow, until the end.
