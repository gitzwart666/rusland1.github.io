  A Russian Hall of Fame can only begin one way: by launching it with none other than Yuri Gagarin. On April 12, 1961, at the age of 27, this humble young man stepped into the [Vostok 1](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1), was shot into space, and returned two hours later as a global icon.

#### The First

There are doubts about whether Gagarin was really the first person in space. Some claim others went before him but didn't survive. Gagarin, they say, didn't deserve the honor because he didn't land according to the rules (inside the Vostok 1 capsule).

Check out [Yuri Gagarin Was Not The First Man In Space](https://youtu.be/wKYfEjg0liU) (Spark, 2018, 50 min), [Cosmonaut Cover-Up](https://youtu.be/Kbwx4Ci1vNo) (Timeline, 2018, 50 min), and [Was Gagarin really the first man in space?](https://youtu.be/ZoyHzeT3aoc) (Point, 2013, 5 min). Read [Was Gagarin really the first man in space?](https://www.rbth.com/history/331849-before-gagarin-not-first-space) (Russia Beyond, 2020) and [Why Yuri Gagarin Remains the First Man in Space, Even Though He Did Not Land Inside His Spacecraft](https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/why-yuri-gagarin-remains-first-man-space-even-though-he-did-not-land-inside-his) (Smithsonian, 2010). Regardless of the debates, Yuri Gagarin remains the first human to venture into space and return to tell the tale.

#### USSR vs. USA

More important than who the first person in space was: they were Soviet, not American. USSR 1 - USA 0.

The first human on the moon, eight years after Gagarin’s feat, was a significant achievement. But by then, the USSR had claimed the first prize. Now, everyone knows Neil Armstrong, while Gagarin is slowly being forgotten outside of Russia. Not by the Russians though—they won the space race, and that’s how it will always be.

#### April 12, 1961

Before the launch, Yuri Gagarin, from [Klushino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klushino), addressed all of humanity with these words: **дорогие друзья, близкие и незнакомые, соотечественники, люди всех стран и континентов** – dear friends, both near and far, fellow countrymen, people of all nations and continents. See [Russian Speech: Yuri Gagarin](https://youtu.be/Mq_aReKjSYg) (Boost Your Russian, 2020, 2 min).

And when the moment finally arrived, he didn’t shout "Help!" or "Oh my God," but [Поехали!](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8!) (*Poyekhali!*)—Let’s go!

#### Back on Earth

Things went wrong that day, but none with fatal consequences. Just under two hours later, Gagarin was back on solid ground, although life would never be the same for him again.

#### World Tour

Two days after his flight, he was greeted in Moscow as a hero. This was the start of a world tour, which took him to countries like Brazil, Canada, [Cuba](https://youtu.be/Vd0B-zyxrL4), [England](https://youtu.be/e3BeN03geXs), and [Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENvGNdTLcEU).

<br/>

In London, on July 11, Gagarin appeared on the BBC for an interview (with a translator). He was even asked if he really was the first. Throughout, Gagarin looked calm and upbeat, as always.

#### March 27, 1968

Less than seven years after his return, Yuri Gagarin died in a plane crash at the age of 34. Once again, theories abound.
