  A tattooed hand or neck, no one is shocked or surprised anymore. Tattoos have become normal. Maybe even boring. It’s a bit different with the face tattoo. Very *in your face*. Or maybe not (anymore)? About the circles (Russian, of course) where the face tattoo has become normal and about the people who live with it every day.

#### Rappers

[Face](https://rusland1.nl/en/muziek/20200227-face-3x/), [Kizaru](https://rusland1.nl/en/muziek/190525-kizaru-3x/), [Ганвест](https://www.mtv.ru/news/ganvest/), [Morgenshtern](https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/332731-meet-morgenstern-first-man-woman-of-the-year) (who [regrets](https://www.starhit.ru/novosti/morgenshtern-jaleet-o-tatuirovkah-na-litse-217946/) it), [Скруджи](https://24smi.org/celebrity/9892-skrudzhi.html) and many more. All of them have tattoos **на лице** (on their faces). It sometimes seems more important than their *skills*.

So far, only men are listed. No female Russian rapper with a face tattoo has been found (yet). This may have to do with an advantage men have, and women do not: tattoos can help men avoid military service.

#### Fakers

After Russia’s victory [against Spain](https://youtu.be/gHPke43iqNg) in the 2018 World Cup, Alexander Tarasov, also known as [T-killah](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-killah), supposedly had the words [Russia and Igor](https://handofmoscow.com/2018/07/02/the-rapper-made-a-bet-with-a-tattoo-on-the-face-in-case-of-a-victory-of-russian-national-team-over-spain/) tattooed on his face. Igor, after goalkeeper [Akinfejev](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Akinfejev), who saved the penalties. It turned out to be [false](https://handofmoscow.com/2018/07/06/tattoo-in-honor-akinfeev-face-prepareschema-rapper-turned-out-to-be-false/). No one was impressed by his lip service anymore; see [Тату Россия](https://youtu.be/pdil44kReto) (2018), text [here](https://unotices.com/page-text.php?id=114065).

<br/>

#### Vladimir Roslyakov

On a different level is Vladimir Roslyakov (17). After seeing American rapper [6ix9ine](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/6ix9ine), he decided: I need that too. He pestered his mother until she not only allowed it but also paid for it.

See [Boy, 17, has his whole face tattooed like rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine](https://youtu.be/rEPY6yHSKUY) (Live News 24, 2020, 2 m). Read [Regrets, he'll have a few...](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11510391/russian-boy-face-tattoos-rapper-tekashi-6ix9ine/) (The Sun, 2020) and [Russian teen has face covered in tattoos](https://scallywagandvagabond.com/2020/04/russian-teen-vladimir-roslyakov-tattoos-face-covered-tekashi-6ix9ine-rapper/) (Scallywag & Vagabond, 2020). A recent addition to his collection was reported in [Kid who tattooed face to look like rapper 6ix9ine gets even more bold inkings](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/kid-who-tattooed-face-look-22985736) (Daily Star, 2020).

#### Nikolay Markelov and Lesya Toumaniantz

Before Roslyakov, Nikolay Markelov and Lesya Toumaniantz made a similar claim to fame. Markelov in 2017: see [Russian man who kept thinking the slogan 'Nothing left to lose' gets it tattooed around his mouth](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4999908/Russian-man-gets-left-lose-tattoo-face.html) (Daily Mail) and [Fashion for face tattoos in Krasnoyarsk: inscriptions on the face](https://youtu.be/-W9aEoiL5oE) (Телекомпания ТВК, 2017, 3 m).

Toumaniantz earlier, in 2013. See articles in [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/472779/tatts-love-tattooist-inks-his-name-across-girlfriends-face-on-the-day-they-meet/) and [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273234/Man-tattoos-girlfriends-FACE--met-24-hours-earlier.html), and optionally watch [Disaster – Face Tattoo After First Date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqB6wHFted0) (The Young Turks, 2013, 4 m).
