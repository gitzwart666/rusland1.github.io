  Nobody in the West drives a Russian car or uses a Russian computer. You'd have
  to be crazy: even Russians prefer BMWs and Apple. But if you're smart, your
  smartphone is powered by Russian technology. That is, if you're using
  Telegram.

#### Goodbye WhatsApp

In 2020, [WhatsApp](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp) reached the milestone of [two billion](https://www.nu.nl/tech/6030402/whatsapp-heeft-nu-twee-miljard-gebruikers.html) users, which the company (owned by Facebook since 2014) said made them [humbled and honored](https://blog.whatsapp.com/two-billion-users-connecting-the-world-privately/?lang=en). But there was little humility to be seen in the new terms of service the messaging app announced barely a year later. The changes basically boiled down to two choices: either give up more of your privacy (as your personal data would now be shared with Facebook), or stop using the app.

Delayed [due to 'confusion'](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/01/16/whatsapp-stelt-omstreden-privacy-update-uit-vanwege-verwarring-a4027851) (NRC, 16-01-2021) or [due to controversy and misunderstandings](https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/whatsapp-voorwaarden-2021-facebook/) (iCulture, 16-01-2021), but the damage (or rather, the good) was already done. Masses of new users for [Signal](https://signal.org/nl/) and Russia's [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). (More about WhatsApp below.)

<br/>

#### Telegram on the Rise

The year started off well for [Pavel Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov) (1984), founder (along with his brother [Nikolai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Durov), 1980) of both [VK](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(sociaal_netwerk)) and [Telegram](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(applicatie)). On [January 12](https://t.me/durov/147), he announced that Telegram had gained 25 million users in just three days.

In two sentences, he gave both an explanation and a jab: "People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users."

Telegram's valuation also saw an instant boost. See [Telegram at $30bln. Telegram capitalizes on problems at WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter](https://thebell.io/en/telegram-at-30bln/) (The Bell, 26-01-2021).

#### Telegram vs Signal

Telegram stores files not on your phone but on its own servers. You can use it to send large files, follow groups and channels (even for learning Russian), and much more.

In terms of security, Telegram (according to Vice, [not as secure as you think](https://www.vice.com/nl/article/jgqqv8/telegram-is-niet-veilige-app-als-je-denkt)) might lose out to Signal, which is recommended by [Edward Snowden](https://numrush.nl/reden-overstappen-whatsapp-signal/) and [Elon Musk](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk). But on the other hand, Signal always requires a phone number, while on Telegram you can register with just a username.

#### Ban and Exile

Both Telegram and the Durov brothers are sources of pride for Russia, or so you'd think. But in reality, the Russian Federation tried to ban Telegram in 2018, only to realize two years later that it was pointless.
