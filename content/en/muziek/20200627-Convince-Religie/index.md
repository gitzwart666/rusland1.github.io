  Being convinced of one thing, swearing by another, with religion you can go in any direction. The guys from ‘Venomous d-beat crust hardcore beast’ Convince (Moscow) are *convinced* that it all means nothing. To say the least. Their **Религия** (Religion) is more anti-religion.

#### Terror

Strong words about (and mostly against) religion. It is **террор** (terror), and **зло** (evil). Also the **кнут** (knout, whip) that drives you into the pen (**что отправит в загон**). You will pray (**ты будешь молиться**) but will not be saved (**не будешь спасён**). Lyrics for the track on [Bandcamp](https://convince666.bandcamp.com/track/--17) and below.

<br/>

#### Jawbreaker

From the album *Russian Jawbreaker* (2020), a [smashing ear-wrencher](https://idioteq.com/venomous-d-beat-crust-hardcore-beast-convince-rolls-out-smashing-ear-wrencher-russian-jawbreaker/) according to Idioteq, where that venomous beast from the intro comes from. Old songs were re-recorded, and that makes a big difference. Религия (Religion) first appeared eight years earlier on the underground compilation [Российский Краст Обстрел / Russian Crust Cannonade](https://imhotape.bandcamp.com/album/russian-crust-cannonade) (2012); Convince [here](https://imhotape.bandcamp.com/track/convince).



Also from *Jawbreaker* and in the same vein as Религия is [Грязь больших городов](https://convince666.bandcamp.com/track/--18) (Dirt of Big Cities). Full album (20 min) on [Bandcamp](https://convince666.bandcamp.com/album/russian-jawbreaker) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6XlMag6rjw7P4kq02Hj7iC?si=z5ZyFPOwSIuLLrDLGpKQNA).

&nbsp; &nbsp; Blind faith<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blind obedience<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don't think about anything extra<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spirituality of slavery<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You will pray<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You will not be saved<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion is the whip<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That drives you into the pen

&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion is terror<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion is evil<br/>


&nbsp; &nbsp; Faithful, unfaithful<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your own and others<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The greedy despot<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Controls you<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hatred in the heart<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will justify the slaughter<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who prayed<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By a different book<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion is terror<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion is evil<br/>
