  “Band biographies are usually boring to ugly, and after reading them, you feel
  sorry for the writer, so we’ll try to keep it short.” This is how the bio of Skverna, a power trio with songs about **про котов, партизан и всяческую сумятицу** – cats, partisans, and all kinds of confusion – begins on their [VK](https://vk.com/skvernaband) page.

There isn’t much more to say about Skverna (also **Скверна**, but not to be confused with [this](https://youtu.be/SYLj2H6LNZ0)). The number of views on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmOIi6etV7N5f2hdeBYTqw) would be higher if only their mothers checked it out once a month. Too bad for those moms. Help out the sons and do yourself a favor: this comes highly recommended.

#### Бутово

From **Долгие проводы** (2019).

Butovo is the name of a [district](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE) in Moscow (just outside the [МКАД](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0) or ring road), large enough for a [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severnoye_Butovo_District) and [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhnoye_Butovo_District). It’s also an area with a lot of history. Though the song isn’t about that, it’s worth knowing.

#### Привет красавица

From **Привет** (2017).

A hello to a beautiful girl – for more details, you’ll have to listen and hopefully understand. The lyrics weren’t found online, but they’ll be posted below as soon as the email currently waiting in Moscow is kindly answered (**Привет Скверна**).
