  Brace yourself for something that looks a bit friendlier than it sounds:
  Vuara from [Petrozavodsk](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrozavodsk) or
  [Петрозаводск](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA) 
  (Karelia). Their self-description (on Bandcamp) reads more like a warning: 
  "A clot of dark and chaotic sound straight from the belly of Karelian swamps,
  escaping from the throat with a cry of socio-political longing."

Vuara is still young. Music videos are for later, and their repertoire is still limited. Just one album, but it weighs heavy enough for two: **Свобода шума** (Freedom of Noise, 2020). Here are two songs: one about less (words) and one about without (people). Even with the lyrics in front of you, understanding them is an art in itself – and today we’re focusing on that reading aspect.

#### В словах всё меньше слов
(lyrics also available with the track on [Bandcamp](https://vuara.bandcamp.com/track/--14))
<br/>
<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; when silence deafened the air,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; when thought understood idleness,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; a dull dream was torn apart by the crackling<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; of vocal cords<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; hearing lost its touch<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; from the burns of silence<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; and in words there are fewer and fewer words<br/>
