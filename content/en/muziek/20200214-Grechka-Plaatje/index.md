#### Prikrasnaja kartina
A **картина** can be anything – an image, a photo, or a painting. "Picture" should cover it all, but Grechka still can’t reach it.

In the opening verse, it's already mentioned that **между нами дождь, и расстояние**: between us, there is rain and distance. It doesn't get much better in the chorus: **Ты прекрасная картина, которой не увижу я**: you are a beautiful picture that I will not see. Yet she knows it’s beautiful. And out of reach, above all. What will never happen (**то, что никогда не произойдёт**) is you and me (**это ты и я**).

Poor **Гречка** (buckwheat).

#### Corona
As a promoted footnote: at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, buckwheat (along with toilet paper) became a sought-after item in Russia. In the video below, Anna Strelkovskaia ([Russian from Russia](https://www.russianfromrussia.com/)) explains Russia's love for buckwheat (**гречка**), and "why it’s one of the first things people stockpile when a crisis is coming."  
Toilet paper will always remain a mystery. Buckwheat and toilet paper at a low point in [Genius Russian YouTuber Spreads Coronavirus](https://youtu.be/w-f4j0nNmW4) (March 11, 2020) from the outspoken NFKRZ.
