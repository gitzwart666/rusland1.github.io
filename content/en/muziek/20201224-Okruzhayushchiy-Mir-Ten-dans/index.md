  As little as there is to be found about **Окружающий Мир** (The World Around), there's
  just as little to report. Virtually nothing. And there wasn't much to choose from either.
  It was **Танцуй со мной** (Dance with me) or nothing. Well then.

#### Танцуй со мной (Dance with Me)

<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Slow cigarette smoke<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spreads everywhere<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I'm walking my girlfriend home<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We drank all night<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Danced all evening<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We just wanted<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To feel lighter together.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Cry, girl, dance with me<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I like all of this so much<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I want to spend<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All night with you until dawn.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Slow cigarette smoke<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fades everywhere<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm walking my girlfriend home<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We danced all night,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hugged, kissed<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How sad it is<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That we parted so soon.
