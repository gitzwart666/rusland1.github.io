Almost all Russians love their country, but not all love their leader(s). Especially not that one. Criminal State (est. 2010) makes it clear. Lyrics below, with translation [here](https://rus-songs.ru/tekst-pesni-criminal-state-putin-perevod-slova/). Explicit lyrics.

<br/>


#### Путин (2014)

&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to live freely<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; so that no one hinders us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; so that all scum dies the f*** out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the cop and politician suck it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; punks don't love Putin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; they reject all the bulls***<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; governments can f*** off<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; all politicians to prison<br/>


&nbsp;&nbsp; Chorus: Putin, you're a bastard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Putin the b**** lies a lot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only talks, that's it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reads his speech from paper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says there’s no war<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Promises freedom for all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Independence in everything<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead tightens passport control<br/>


&nbsp;&nbsp; We won't obey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't need a president<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A state within a state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We've created our own<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have our own nationality<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Punks united forever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And as long as the system lives<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; punk will never die

#### F the War

More stance-taking in **Fuck The Warship!!!**, from 2022.  <br/>
'Age-restricted', only on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/hNWV758XGvY?si=GM0DrEv49L-MHgMR). <br/>
From the statement accompanying it:

*We are for world peace, for the end of this war, which threatens not only us and Ukraine, but the whole world. The golden elite, as always, is trying to drag everyone into the meat grinder for their own benefit and prosperity. They divide and conquer. War is a business.* <br/>

<br/>

#### Hell Outside the Window (2020)

Hell outside the window, also featuring Putin at the start.


&nbsp;&nbsp; Grey streets of working-class neighborhoods<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There's garbage and dirt, little that's good<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The walls are scribbled with all kinds of s***<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Misery and boredom live right next to you<br/>


&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody cares about their damn lives<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From work to home, get drunk on the weekends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Day after day, you wait for a miracle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so your life flows in a circle<br/>


&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell outside the window – it's what we deserve<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We let them rape our lives<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the scum be above us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's only slums, collapse, poverty<br/>


&nbsp;&nbsp; Broken asphalt, expired food in stores<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every thug carries a blade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cops lurking in every yard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no light, only destruction everywhere.

#### Bonus: Exploited

'Путин' is a cover of The Exploited's 'Maggie' (which obviously refers to [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)). It also circulates as Maggie with some ugly additions, as seen here. Punk remains punk.
