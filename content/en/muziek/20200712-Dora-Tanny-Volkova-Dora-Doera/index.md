  Dora, or Дора, also known as mentaldora, actually **Дарья Шиханова**, comes from
  **Саратов** ([Saratov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratov)) and was born in 1999.
  A young twentysomething, but presents herself as even younger. She describes her music
  as 'cute rock,' and that probably has something to do with it.

#### Superdoera

In Дорадура (Doradoera), Dora talks about herself. Because Dora goes through things, and things go wrong. With dates and such. Flights of fancy from the heart. All because (**всё потому, что**) Dora is a fool (**Дора – дура**): Dora is a fool. Dora is even **Супер-дура**, a super fool, superdoeradoradoera. Pretty catchy, and it's fun to try to follow along with that alliteration, but it leans quite a bit toward teen pop. Especially when you see the [video](https://youtu.be/WNadEfGnV04) that is not allowed here. There's also a [lyric video](https://youtu.be/-HYxAHXX-8U), a [karaoke piano version](https://youtu.be/5x74_E4vEWg), and an [acoustic performance](https://youtu.be/7-QG5gYumEw), none of which are allowed or available.

#### Tanny Volkova 

Fortunately, there's Tanny Volkova (Таня Волкова), also born in 1999, from [Odessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa), Ukraine – but Tanny speaks Russian, and she raps too. Originally a vlogger, which shows in her introduction to Doradoera. Where she says that this is not really a cover, but her version. With guitar, bass, and drums, which balances out the sweetness, making it sound simply super.

With a comment from Dora herself under the video on YouTube: **Да хватит прикидываться, ты же и есть Дора** (stop pretending, you are Dora), but she is doing Tanny a disservice there.

#### Sisterly

A meeting had to happen, and a joint version too. At the same time, a little competition over who can look most like they're still fifteen. See [Поем песни с Дорой](https://youtu.be/4zKs_WgjSJs) (singing songs with Dora, 2020, 7 min), announced in [встреча с моей... сестрой??](https://youtu.be/kngG-_wWfPs) (meeting with my... sister??, 2020, 9 min), with the crowning moment being the version below.
