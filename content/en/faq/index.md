<summary>Who is behind Rusland1?</summary>
This website is largely a one-person hobby project. I love languages and fell in love with Russian. I was taught by Inna Teslya (Rusles For You, Breda), which helped immensely. Often distracted during the hours I was supposed to be studying, and this is the result.<br/>
