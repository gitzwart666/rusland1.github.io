  And then it became war. Or should we say began the special military
  operation. On [February 24
  2022](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russische_invasie_van_Oekra%C3%AFne_sinds_2022)
  Russian troops entered Ukraine. It was allowed [neither war nor
  invasion](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/26/russia-bans-media-outlets-from-using-words-war-invasion-a76605)
  be called, but it was akin to both.

#### Speech

Putin gave a [speech](https://youtu.be/1qS6J-WbTD8?si=QbUXxh1JGA0MCck9) (see also [here](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/02/24/letterlijk-zo-kondigde-russische-president-poetin-de-aanval-op/) and [here](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/full-text-putin-s-declaration-of-war-on-ukraine/)) and, one assumes, believed in a quick victory. It turned into a disaster for everyone, and over two years later, the likelihood of terrible escalation seems more realistic than that of a quick end.

#### War

On Friday, March 22, 2024, through [Dmitri Peskov](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Peskov), the Kremlin also spoke of “war.” See, among others.

- Kremlin spokesman now speaks of 'war' against Ukraine](https://nos.nl/artikel/2513788-kremlin-woordvoerder-spreekt-nu-van-oorlog-tegen-oekraine) (NIS)
- Russia is at war with Ukraine, according to Kremlin spokesman](https://www.nd.nl/varia/varia/1217438/rusland-is-volgens-kremlinwoordvoerder-in-oorlog-met-oekraine) (Nederlands Dagblad)
- Russia Admits It's 'In State of War' Two Years Into Ukraine Invasion](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-admits-its-state-war-two-years-ukraine-invasion-1882209) (Newsweek)
- The Kremlin says Russia is in a 'state of war' in Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kremlin-russia-state-of-war-ukraine-putin-west-peskov-rcna144606) (NBC News)


Poetin zelf deed dat ook, en eerder, zie [Putin declares ‘war’ – aloud – forsaking his special euphemistic operation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/22/putin-war-ukraine-special-operation/) (Washington Post, 22-12-2022) en [In Russia, the talk is of 'war'- even from Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-talk-is-war-even-putin-2023-06-08/) (Reuters, 08-06-2023).

#### This site

Even well before Operation Russia1 (read: its creator) had come to a standstill. The last piece posted was in 2021. Now the project is being resumed. It was and is mostly about the Russian language here, and it has not changed substantially. (See: [How the War Has Changed the Russian Language](https://youtu.be/DBQT5yjqeco?si=DAV-GQ68I4JSSeG6), Easy Russian, 2023, 28 m.)

#### Statement

The objective once described (in the [FAQ](https://www.rusland1.nl/en/faq/)) does not change either. There is more rather than less reason to encourage learning and admiring the Russian language. It is under pressure, as evidenced by, among other things, [Up to ten percent fewer people start Russian courses in Ghent](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/09/27/tot-tien-procent-minder-mensen-beginnen-aan-opleiding-russisch-i/) (VRT, 27-09-2022) and [Significantly less interest in Russian courses](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20220908_96112619) (Nieuwsblad, 09-09-2022).

As far as anything of a statement is needed, the editors concur: “It is extremely important just in these moments of crisis to train people who understand the ‘enemy’” - although instead of “the enemy” it could have read “Russia” or “the Russians.

#### Links

Many links no longer work. Channels have been discontinued, changed names or switched to [Ukrainian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQg2AzkYEueS5giD84wxLdg/featured).
Also pasted-in videos disappeared, it was painfully noted. Being worked on.

Checking all links is impossible. Notification of a dead link is appreciated.
Playlists on YouTube are replenished, disappeared videos have been removed.

Stay tuned. Мир миру
