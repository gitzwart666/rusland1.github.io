  This might sound like music to many ears: learning Russian without grammar. Is
  this a case of ‘too good to be true,’ or is it really possible? The advice of
  [Benjamin Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_and_Bankrupt) (Bald and
  Bankrupt on YouTube) is clear. Forget grammar. In fact, (from the description
  under the video embedded here), ‘throw away the grammar books and you'll make
  massive progress very quickly.’

  Do you really need to study (a lot of) grammar to learn Russian? Bald and
  Bankrupt says no.

#### Vocabulary first

Being a vlogger, Bankrupt (or Rich) exaggerates a bit, of course. Still, he manages to get by in all Russian-speaking countries. And when there are language problems: *‘Every single time I’ve been misunderstood, has been because either I didn’t know the Russian word, or I didn’t understand the Russian word that they were using. It’s been a lack of vocabulary – that’s what’s always caused the problem. Grammar has never been an issue.'*

So maybe the lesson is not that grammar is unimportant, but that vocabulary is even more important. But watch for yourself.

#### With NFKRZ
The topic also comes up in a conversation (in Russian, of course) between Bald and Bankrupt and Roman Abalin (NFKRZ). The Brit makes himself understood and proves his point in [Speaking Russian with Bald and Bankrupt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loAxQe14ke0) (NFKRZ, 2019, 17 m).

And if grammar is no longer necessary, you might as well check out more of their casual chats, like [Drinking Vodka](https://youtu.be/EvPB86Ziy1M) (2019, 27 m) and [Russian Hood Adventures](https://youtu.be/y2vaswVqqoo) (2019, 27 m), both from NFKRZ. There’s also a portrait video: [Bald and Bankrupt: The Fearless Brit Exploring Russia](https://youtu.be/3pvbujNk6Ho) (NFKRZ, 2019, 14 m).
