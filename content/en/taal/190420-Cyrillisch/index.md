  About the history of the Cyrillic script, and about the founders Cyril and
  Methodius.
draft: false
intro: >-


  [Cyril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_of_Thessalonica) and
  [Methodius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodius_of_Thessalonica), brothers
  and Christian monks, are at the foundation of the Russian script. It is called
  [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script) because Cyril invented
  it, in the primitive form of the [Glagolitic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glagolitic_alphabet),
  which was revised and simplified after his death. Cyril and Methodius came from
  [Thessalonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessalonica) (Greece) and were
  missionaries: the script was meant to translate the Bible and spread the faith.
