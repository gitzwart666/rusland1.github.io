#### Three Forms (or Actually Four)

Masculine, feminine, and formal or plural: verbs in the past tense take on only three forms. Or actually four, but the form for **оно** (it) is rarely used. After all, an **оно** doesn’t (or didn’t) do much.

<br/>

#### Gender and Number

You could also say that past tense conjugations only take gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) into account. They do not change by person. The forms for we, they, and you (formal) are the same. I, you, and he/she take the same form if the gender matches. In Russian, when you see "I thought" or "you said," you immediately know whether it was a man or a woman. Unlike in the present tense, these forms are different.

<br/>

#### Stem + л, ла, ли (or ло)

To form the past tense, you first need to find the stem of the verb. You often do this by removing the last two letters. (Also see: Rule 7: Finding the Stem on [8 Simple Rules for Russian Verb Conjugation](https://www.thoughtco.com/russian-verb-conjugation-rules-4178979), ThoughtCo. 2018). You then attach **л**, **ла**, or **ли** to it (or sometimes **ло**), and that's it.

I (m) thought: **я думал**. From **думать** (to think), **дума** (stem) + **л**, **ла**, or **ли**. He thought: **он думал**. You (m) thought: **ты думал**. If the subjects are female, **думал** becomes slightly more elegant as it changes to **думала**.

You said: **ты сказал** (m.) **ты сказала** (f.)
