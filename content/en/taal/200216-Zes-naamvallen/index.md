#### The Six Cases

Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and locative. The six [Russian grammatical cases](http://www.russischegrammatica.nl/naamvallen/) (in English: *cases*, in Russian **падежи**) affect words, names, numbers—basically everything, and all the time.



| Case / Case Name              | Падеж        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| nominative / nominative        | имени́тельный |
| genitive / genitive            | роди́тельный  |
| dative / dative                | да́тельный    |
| accusative / accusative        | вини́тельный  |
| instrumental / instrumental    | твори́тельный |
| locative / prepositional       | предло́жный   |


<br/>

(Abbreviations: **Им**, **Рд**, **Дт**, **Вн**, **Тв**, **Пр** – sometimes a single letter is used)



<br/>

#### A Logical System

Knowing when to use each case is usually easy to determine. The system is logically structured, and you get used to it quickly. Moreover, you can do a lot with it. The Russian cases enrich the language while also keeping it compact.



Finally: Finnish has [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish) cases, and Hungarian has [21](http://www.hongaarsetaal.nl/Hongaars) – six should be manageable, right? There were even [seven](https://youtu.be/7OVuNBWS-e8) cases at one point. You learn them one by one, or you can take a quick look at how these six fit together. The clips below (with study tips) are also helpful for those who need a summary and an overview at a later stage.
