#### 1100 hours?

1100 hours, says Denis Fedorov, who refers to science. Languages in 5 categories of difficulty. 1100 hours to master Russian, which falls into category 4. That's about 1 year of studying 3 hours a day or 3 years at 1 hour a day. Watching videos probably counts too.

#### Slozjni

This [Самый сложный язык для изучения](https://youtu.be/mkWtp9oH8bQ) (The hardest language to learn) places Russian in the middle of the three and estimates the study time at 1110 hours. Apparently, you can also learn Hindi, Vietnamese, and a few others in the same time.
