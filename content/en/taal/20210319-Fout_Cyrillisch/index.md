  Cyrillic can do.

#### Misuse of Cyrillic

The letter Я (also the word for I) has nothing to do with an R. And the И/и is an I/i, not an N/n. If it is used that way, then disasters like **Яussiaи** are the consequences.

Also bad is when the beautiful Д/д is portrayed as an A. Thus **Воядт** was made of [Borat](https://youtu.be/Xi5L8Lucx3s), and that really can't be done

<br/>

#### For Ethical Treatment of Russian

More examples at [Faux Cyrillic on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxcyrillic/) (Faux as Faцx). There also [Real men don't use faux cyrillic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxcyrillic/comments/gp7oid/real_men_dont_use_faux_cyrillic/), perhaps (for once) a good use of faux cyrillic.

And on Twitter (@NoFauxCyrillic) at the [People for Ethical Treatment of Russian](https://twitter.com/NoFauxCyrillic), whose [statement](https://twitter.com/NoFauxCyrillic/status/994918068425035776): 'Russian is our language and an integral part of our culture. It's not an exotic gimmick for you to score a point or chase clicks. Please don't abuse it. Our Я is not your R.'
