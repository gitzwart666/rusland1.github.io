  Russian sentences for beginners. About word order and how to form sentences in Russian.

intro: >
  In Russian, you can say a lot with few words. The language is compact, and many sentences are simple. "He is an engineer" is already short, but Russians cut it in half: "He engineer" – that’s all you need to say. The language requires few words but the right ones.

#### Word Order

*Cats eat mice* can also be expressed in Russian as *mice eat cats*. There’s a lot of freedom in word order. The price for that freedom is declensions and cases. They keep sentences simple but constantly change the words. **кошки едят мышей** or **мышей едят кошки** – the grammar tells you who is eating whom.

The example of cats and mice comes from the video below (from 1:33)

More explanation from Russian grammar. **Оля была в Москве**, **Была Оля в Москве**, and **В Москве была Оля**: three ways to say the same thing (Olya was in Moscow).
