#### Звезда

A great first option is **Звезда** (Star). With a page of [explanation and translation](https://explorerussian.com/shine-my-star-learn-russian-through-songs/) (Explore Russian). The song (2013) is by **Глюк’oZa** or Glukoza ([website](http://www.glukoza.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glukoza)). From the same channel are [Вечная молодость](https://youtu.be/MKjFuddFkH8) (Eternal Youth), also with [explanation and translation](https://explorerussian.com/learn-russian-songs-eternal-youth/), and an analysis of [Синие сугробы](https://explorerussian.com/learn-russian-through-songs-snowdrifts/) (Blue Snowdrifts).

#### Тебе

A bit on the sweet side but still fun is **Тебе**. "You" in the dative case, meaning for or to you. **Лишь тебе** (only for you) are **эти песни мои** (these songs of mine) and **все слова о любви** (all the words about love). With English translation, and nice big letters. From [Изучайте русский с носителем](https://www.youtube.com/user/umeuvse/featured) (learn Russian with a native speaker), aka Elen Sheff.

#### Better

Choosing for yourself is always the most fun and effective. See the Music section for options in multiple directions.
