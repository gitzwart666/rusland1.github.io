  Russian alphabet – apps and clips to quickly and easily learn the Russian ABC.
draft: false
intro: "Learning Russian begins with that fascinating alphabet. 33 characters, just 7 more than in our ABC, so how hard can it be? Find out for yourself, of course. Try apps, for example: plenty of options on Google Play and Apple App Store, often for free. Or by watching and listening to clips –\_also for free. The second language is usually English."

#### Apps

Starting simple is recommended. For Android users: [Russian alphabet for kids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jqsoft.games.kids.alphabet) is great for beginners and looks cheerful. You’ll also learn some basic words right away. [Russian Alphabet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dgsoftware.russianalphabet_sl) is less about cheerfulness but is clear and practical. Some example words are (too) difficult for beginners. 
For Apple users, there's also a [Russian Alphabet](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/russian-alphabet/id389927786?mt=8). And a [Russian Alphabet Now](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/russian-alphabet-now/id1191381438?mt=8) (with cursive letters too), but that costs 2 dollars. [Russian Alphabet Learn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/russian-alphabet-learn/id664969042?mt=8) is free.

<br/>

#### YouTube

Even easier is watching videos. And once you've watched them a few times, you can play them while doing other things. Plenty of options here too. Though again, everything is in English – but *hey*.

- [Russian Alphabet in pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j0FxOMX2qY)<br/>With pictures and a carefree tune that says: this is fun. You need that sometimes.
- [Russian Alphabet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IsoeDitsBA)<br/>
  Handy and clear, but rather fast-paced. There's also a milder (slower) version: [Russian Alphabet – Slower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhtL3SJNvWI).
- [Russian ABC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhrSpf8kaqQ)<br/>
  A bit *Soviet* in style, but great for those who don't want to be distracted by fancy design or overly perfect sound. Old-school reliability.


**Russian Alphabet in 10 minutes (or 12)**

The title is misleading, and it doesn’t look very *flashy* – but ‘Learn Russian alphabet in 10 minutes!’ has a logical structure and teaches you some words along the way. Bonus: it’s narrated by a lovely voice, in her English and **по-русски** (*pa roesski*, in Russian). You’ll want that too – so listen and repeat, another 10 minutes (or really 12), and then 10 more times. **Удачи** *(oedatsji)*, good luck!
