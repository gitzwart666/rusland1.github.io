  Typing Russian letters and characters isn’t easy at first, but it’s definitely worth the effort. It opens up a whole new world—or at least a lot of the internet. It’s also necessary if you want to do anything in Russian.

Two ways to type in Cyrillic.

 

#### Adjusting your keyboard

Setting your keyboard to Russian isn’t hard (search for [How to install the Cyrillic Keyboard for Mac](https://learnrussian.rt.com/speak-russian/how-install-cyrillic-keyboard-mac) or [How to add Russian keyboard for Windows 10](https://russianwithtamara.nl/russian-keyboard/) if needed). However, using it can be tricky, especially if you can’t see the Russian letters. QWERTY becomes [Йцукен](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCUKEN), ABC turns into фис, etc. It gets easier with a Russian [keyboard](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/russisch-toetsenbord-usb/9200000076125144/) or [sticker set](https://www.toetsenbordstickers.nl/zoeken.html?q=russische+sticker). Another option is a [cover](https://youtu.be/xzAeXy7Z5CA), or you can even get your keyboard [laser-engraved](https://youtu.be/zKT5F1GKYmM).

The layout is still different, and it may take a while before you can type quickly and switch smoothly between systems. See [How Much Effort Will it Take to Switch Over to the Russian Keyboard?](https://www.superprof.co.uk/blog/switching-to-the-cyrillic-keyboard/) (Superprof.co, 2018).

#### Online Keyboard

A simpler and more user-friendly option is an online keyboard that lets you type **фрис** when you enter "fris" or **гин** when you type "gin." You make a **и** with an "i," a **й** with a "j," a **п** with a "p," and so on. This is possible on sites like [Lexilogos.com](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/russian.htm) and [Branah.com](https://www.branah.com/russian), where you can click Russian letters or type them in the text box. You can also use [online-keyboard.org](https://online-keyboard.org/Russisch-Toetsenbord/RU-Russian/german/nl-NL). The downside is you’ll have to copy and paste a lot.

[Typeit.org](https://russian.typeit.org/) is quick and logical. A = **a**, b = **б** (v = **в**), c = **ц** (s = **с**), etc. Shortcuts for special characters: ` (or §) = **ё**, ’ = **ж**, ] = **щ**, = = **ъ**, ; = **ь**, \ = **э**, [ = **ю**, q = **я**.
