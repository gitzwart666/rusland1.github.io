  It looks like two letters but has an indescribable sound. The 29th letter of the Russian alphabet is quite unique and often causes problems with pronunciation. We are talking about the letter **ы**, a sound not found in many other languages (except perhaps Turkish). As such, it takes some effort to pronounce it correctly.

#### Sounds Like

An indescribable sound, indeed. But people have tried. [Wikipedia](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russisch_alfabet) loosely describes it as “like the u in bunker” (which is far off). [Wikibooks](https://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Russisch/Alfabet) says it’s somewhere between "u" and "j", while [Russisch in Rusland](https://russischinrusland.nl/russisch-alfabet-cyrillisch/) compares it to something between "u" and "i". That’s not entirely wrong, but the suggestion to “try saying *mus* and *mis* at the same time” can be more confusing than helpful.
<br/>

Many have taken a shot at explaining it. One amusing and surprisingly accurate attempt was found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/84d7cr/how_do_you_pronounce_the_letter_ы/): *“Someone once described it to me as that sound you make when someone punches you in the gut”*, with a decent approximation: *“Like an ‘uiee.’”* As Dobby Dobson advises: “Just punch yourself in the stomach” (1:23), though [Ы is it difficult? No!](https://youtu.be/9pRUTWUCuxs) (2017, 2 m) also offers less painful options.
<br/>

Listen for yourself to find your own description. Here's **мыло**, **дым**, and **пыль** (soap, smoke, and dust) in 18 seconds. Also, check out [Russian Sound Ы](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inJAhLCJDlc) (2015, 1 m, with a poem) and [The letter Ы in words](https://youtu.be/YBcomqFQH_4) (2013, 3 m).

#### Pronunciation

Now, how to actually make that sound—without getting punched in the stomach. It may sound complex, like on [How to pronounce Russian letters "Ь", "Ы", "Ц", "Щ" in a proper way]( https://www.ruspeach.com/en/learning/13044/) (Ruspeach):

*“Look at yourself in the mirror, smile and say the English letter E. Then, with a spoon or any other tool, touch your tongue and push it back, so your tongue forms a small hill inside your mouth. Now, pronouncing E with your twisted tongue should produce the Russian Ы sound.”*


**Make a smile**<br/>
A simpler and more enjoyable suggestion comes from Katya (or Катюша) of RussianPod101, in [Weekly Russian Words with Katya – Mammals](https://youtu.be/3Jyo-ag67BU). “Make a big smile and try to giggle.” You’ll encounter this from [1:36](https://youtu.be/3Jyo-ag67BU?t=96) when she introduces **мышь** (mouse).


**Toothbrush**<br/>
Daria Molchanova from Real Russian Club also advocates a good smile, with the tip: “Try to smile as wide as you can” ([0:27](https://youtu.be/w9hogVBFECQ?t=27)). You’ll find out what to do with a toothbrush—it can even be done with a pen! See [Russian pronunciation. The sound Ы](https://youtu.be/dZv0XA4-nDg) (Live Russian, 2017, 3 m).

**Anatomy**<br/>
There’s some anatomy involved in pronouncing **ы**. It’s all about tongue placement (since the Russian word for *tongue* and *language* are the same!). The clips below (which are more useful) illustrate this well.

#### Ы and И
