#### Series

Yaroslava Russian has quite a range. From [Prigozhin's Plane Crash](https://youtu.be/SSq7vRXWKgk?si=hfga4O0-At3ef4hW) (2023, 29 m) to a [Documented Alien](https://youtu.be/zTYQ8-Z4WkI?si=p-kNlvoQiNDtSTdd) (2024, 27 m). Collected in a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk0dFHornymC_Agm2FaGsB0znND_Yc_QQ&si=EnI1v3JNM_CxRTxG), including.

#### Grammar

Russian with Julie deploys the terror of all language students: the super fast-talking newsreader(s). Each snippet ([Vladimir Zhirinovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Zhirinovsky) died, Putin congratulates [Aleksandar Vučić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87)) provides material for minutes of analysis and (especially) grammar.

#### Wimbledon

Anna Cher (Russian From the Heart) was helpful enough to go through a (slightly abbreviated) [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-61131218) three times. First slowly, then with explanations, and at the end quickly - though for her **в нормальном темпе**, at normal pace. What at first seems completely inimitable soon becomes clear. Anna is thanked, and for two years missed, too.

#### MORE


**Boost Your Russian** made eight episodes of News in Slow Russian, collected in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlly00ErnI99IR4QfCwpBsUV5EnBfO3Hl). “News” is a big word for items like [Skinniest House in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x7f5mODSlk) (2021, 6 m), [Postcard from Titanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUMZbFO3lY8) (2021, 7 m) and [Unusual spots for wedding](https://youtu.be/sykakBssebE?si=P3Xp0kIJT5RxPHPj) (2022, 7 m), but that matters little: Kristina's (read-aloud) voice makes everything indigestible.

**Russian with Nastya** covers news vocabulary in [Understand Russian News | Advanced Vocabulary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lbxd84HJFY) (2023, 22 m).

The Russian News for language students series by **Learn Russian** (Stanislav Chernyshov) is mediocre and outdated. 19 brief items in this [playlist ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLeL3RO6WtnX5RZEtg6PExYF2Z47O5GEj) for those nevertheless interested.
