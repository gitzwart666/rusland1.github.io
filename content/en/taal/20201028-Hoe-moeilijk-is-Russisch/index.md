  A frequently asked question that’s not so easy to answer. There are certainly degrees of difficulty (see [How long it takes to learn Russian](https://rusland1.nl/en/taal/190613-hoelang-het-duurt-voor-je-russisch-kunt/); more at the bottom), but what’s a breeze for one person can be a challenge for another. Some can run a marathon with ease, while others struggle to bike even half the distance.

The hardest language to learn is probably one you don’t feel much for, while the easiest is the one that attracts you. But those are clichés, and still don’t answer the question. So, how hard is Russian?

<br/>

### Not difficult at all

Russian isn’t Chinese. And if over [150 million](https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/328250-how-many-people-speak-russian) people (or even [258 million](https://blog.lingoda.com/en/how-many-people-really-speak-russian/)) can speak it, it can’t be that hard. Many Russian words are easy or quickly recognizable. They resemble (or come from) [English](https://youtu.be/KfecDL3JWPA), [German](https://youtu.be/ln6f3d4E_zM), or even Dutch. Check out (besides the examples below) [Любой голландец знает эти 42 русских слова](https://youtu.be/dCfIje4FHls) (Every Dutchman knows these 42 Russian words) by Ари говорит по-Русски (2020, 14 m); also see [10 Russian words that you can easily pronounce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMnUNxP3bIQ) (Comrade Helps, 2019, 2 m).

<br/>
<br/>

Also convenient: several letters from the [Russian alphabet](https://rusland1.nl/en/taal/190412-abctje/) are just like ours; [questions](https://rusland1.nl/en/taal/200229-vraagwoorden/) and [past tense](https://rusland1.nl/en/taal/200217-verleden-tijd/) are often simple; Russian doesn’t have articles, and much more. *Russian is easy!*

### Not that easy

Now, don’t get overconfident. For every ease in Russian, there’s at least one difficulty. Six cases (actually [seven](https://youtu.be/7OVuNBWS-e8)). Each verb has two forms with separate conjugations—and there aren’t just [two conjugation patterns](https://rusland1.nl/en/taal/200216-eerste-en-tweede-vervoeging/), but around [forty](https://youtu.be/rapWYCAUpQo). Then you have verbs of motion, prefixes, gerunds, and much more. No, Russian isn’t Chinese—Russian is harder! Even [Chinese people say so](https://youtu.be/N6H3MgF7ovY?t=53) (more comparisons below). If that sounds exaggerated, try the math with [RusTongue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gqFI6AIjZn32eXGGlHnog), who explains (below) how you can form 597 new words from the root **слово** (word). Russian is [Difficult Even for Native Speakers](https://understandrussia.com/russian-language/) and a [Real hell for foreigners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsLKThGbXAU).

#### Always difficult?

Children and polyglots aside, learning a new language is never easy. See: [Why It's So Hard to Learn Another Language After Childhood](https://time.com/5261446/language-critical-period-age/) (Time, 2018), [Here's when it gets more difficult to learn a new language, according to science](https://www.businessinsider.com/learn-a-new-language-2018-4?international=true&r=US&IR=T) (Business Insider, 2018), and [Why We Struggle Learning Languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBMfg4WkKL8) (Gabriel Wyner, TEDx Talks, 2017, 16 m).

#### Still (or even more so), do it

All the better for the brain: see [What Happens To Your Brain When You Learn a New Language](https://youtu.be/7XKmqy8vFwk) (Unbabel, 2019, 2 m); [The Benefits of Learning A New Language](https://youtu.be/39Ei6gJFDoA) (Keep it in mind, 2019, 3 m), [7 Incredibly Useful Benefits of Learning a New Language](https://youtu.be/YQXY_USilcM) (Luca Lampariello, 2018, 7 m), and [The benefits of a bilingual brain](https://youtu.be/MMmOLN5zBLY) (Mia Nacamulli, TED-Ed 2015, 5 m).
