  A Russian name consists of three parts: a first name (**имя**), a patronymic
  or father's name (**отчество**), and a last or family name (**фамилия**). The
  abbreviation **Ф.И.О.** (**фамилия**, **имя**, **отчество**) is well-known to
  Russians and appears on their passports, driver's licenses, and related
  documents.

#### Son or daughter

The **отчество** (*óhtjestva*) is slightly different for a son than for a daughter. If Vladimir is the father, the patronymic for the son (m) would be Vladimirovich, and for the daughter (f), it would be Vladimirovna (with the stress on the second syllable for both). There are some variations, but not many. Usually, it's the father’s first name + **ович** or **евич** (m), **овна** or **евна** (f).

#### Many forms

In addition to (usually) the family name, the father's name is also used, similar to how we use a surname in the West. If your name is Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov (same first name as your father), you could be referred to as either Ivan Ivanovich or Ivan Ivanov. This is one reason why Russian novels can sometimes make it hard to keep track of who is who.

To make matters worse, Russians often use nicknames, pet names, and shortened forms. Every first name has variations that may not immediately make sense to non-Russians. For example, an Aleksander is also Sasha, and so on.

#### Names and cases

Things get tricky when grammar interferes with names. Russian grammar follows rules you might not expect. For example, a name can be treated as either a noun or an adjective.
